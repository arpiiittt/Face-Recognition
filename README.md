Face Recognition System
Welcome to the Face Recognition System repository! This project implements a face recognition system using Python, leveraging powerful libraries and tools for image processing and machine learning.
Introduction
This project demonstrates how to build a face recognition system using Python. The system is capable of detecting faces in images and videos, and recognizing them based on a pre-trained model. It can be used for various applications such as security systems, attendance tracking, and more.
